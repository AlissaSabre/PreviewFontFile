What is it?
-----------

This is just a small tool to preview (or _test drive_) a font file.
You can pick up a `.ttf` or `.otf` file and try it with any text you want.
(You don't need to _install_ the font into your PC.)

I wrote it primarily for myself.

Environment
-----------

This is a Windows app that runs on .NET/WPF and is written in C#.
It is built with .NET 5.0 SDK.
